1. BRANCH CREATION RULE
* Go to [this](https://github.com/bislara/certificate-system/issues) link and find the issues assigned to you. 
* Create a new branch for each issue. The name of your branch should follow the following rule : **[LABEL (lowercase)]/[ISSUE #]-[TITLE (all lowercase letters and words separated by hyphen(-))]**.
* That is, if the *TITLE* of the issue **#8** is **Dashboard - Development** and *LABEL* assigned to this issue is **Feature**, then the branch name should be **feature/8-dashboard-development**
* Perform all the development activities in this branch and raise PRs accordingly with proper commit message and description along with screenshots, images (if necessary)

2. RULLS FOR PULL REQUEST (PR) RAISE
* Use proper commit message describing the tasks performed in the commit.
* Treat `master` branch as your master branch, i.e. all your PRs should use `master` as the target branch. e.g. `git push origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME` and then use `master` as the target branch while creating PRs.

* Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/bislara/certificate-system`
